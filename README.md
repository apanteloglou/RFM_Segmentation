# RFM_Segmentation
This repository contains the files for the Field Study Project with title RFM Segmentation.
This includes both 4 datasets in csv for each of the segmentations performed (one week data only) along with the python scripts (both in Notebook and .py form) that transform the data and assign the segments to each user.
